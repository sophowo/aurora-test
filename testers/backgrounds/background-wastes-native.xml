			<p>You are a native of the Tundral Wastes. Born into such a harsh environment, you've managed to adapt and perhaps even thrive in this unfortuante land. You've developed skills to survive through the rampant blizzards and against the feral beasts that also call the Wastes home.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong>Athletics, Survival</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong>Cook's utensiles</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong>One of your choice</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong>A set of cook's utensiles, a set of traveler’s clothes, a set of heavy winter clothes, a pair of ice picks, and a small bone trinket from a hunted animal</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>WASTELAND WANDERER</h5>
			<p>Most people in the Wastes belong to a tribe or village, helping to support their community whether by providing general leadership, hunting, or other skills. However, a few individuals choose to wander the Wastes, not allifiating themselves with any particular tribe, sometimes helping them out and sometimes avoiding them entirely. Work with your DM to determine your relationship with the other citizens of the Wastes.</p>

			<p>As a member of a settlement in the Wastes, you'd have performed various roles over the years, but would have one or two particular jobs where you really found your calling.</p>
			<div element="ID_BACKGROUND_FEATURE_TUNDRA_EXPERTISE" />
			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Denizens of the Wastes are some of the people most familiar with the value of cooperation and teamwork you'll meet. Whilst some are overly gullible and easily trusting, they understand the importance of community.</p>
			<h4>VARIANT WASTES NATIVE : TRIBE EXILE</h4>
			<p>Instead of belonging to a specific tribe, some Waste natives are exiles from their former tribes, or never allied with a tribe in the first place. They wander the tundra, sometimes lending their aid to the settlements they come across, and sometimes avoiding them altogether. As an exile, you might stay completely alone, or you might decide to find a small group of similar individuals to travel with. Perhaps you were exiled from a crime you committed (or at least were accused of), or maybe it was a willing choice. In any case, the life of an exile is a generally lonely one and you're more likely to be treated as a strange outsider by those not from the Wastes.</p>
      <p class="indent">Rather than proficiency in a language, you're proficient in cartographer's tools to remain more self sufficient. And instead of cook's utensiles, you start with a yak and two weeks' worth of rations.</p>

			<pAs someone who's spent years on the tundras, you've grown accustomed to their unique challenges. You can spot the signs of an incoming snowstorm or blizzard before it happens, and when foraging for food on the tundra, you can find twice as much. Whilst enganged in other activites such as foraging or navigating, you remain alert to danger.</p>
			<p class="indent">Community is everything in the Wastes. Your settlement, and any others they have a good relationship with, will provide you with lodging and food if necessary. Settlements can send messages to others via expert messengers, allowing you some communication if it's unsafe for you to travel across the tundra.</p>
			<p class="indent">You must contribute to the community, if able. Neglecting your duties may result in the settlements turning against you and refusing you entry inside.</p>
      <p class="indent">You are also fluent in Snowtalk, a purely physical method of communication used on the tundras when voice cannot. Snowtalk can convery simple concepts, such as a path being blocked by a snowdrift or a member of the party being injured, but cannot communicate more sophisticated ideas. Only other creatures fluent in Snowtalk can understand these messages, and they take twice as long to convey as they would if spoken in common. A creature can understand a snowtalk message as long as they can see your silhouette.</p>

			<h4>NEW HOBGOBLIN TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your hobgoblin character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of hobgoblin refinement.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Constitution score increases by 2.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Although hobgoblins reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, they die at like 30 lmao.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Hobgoblins are incredibly lawful, having great respect for their heirachies and societal structures. Most new hobgoblin societies are Neutral, trying to integrate with the rest of the world, but many older socities trend closer to Evil.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Hobgoblins stand taller than humans. Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Your ancestry living in shadowy tundras and bleak caves has improved your vision in dark conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Tradition of Conflict.</em></strong> Hobgoblins have a strict military structure, and each member is educated in the history of war. Whenever you make a History check related to the military history of an object or place, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Will to Persevere.</em></strong> Your grit to carry on and push through opposing forces makes it difficult to stop you from fighting. You can spend any number of hit dice up to your constitution modifier (minimum 1) to add 1d4 per hit die to any saving throw you make. You can use this ability after seeing the roll but before the DM tells you if you fail or succeed. After using this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Goblin.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong>Hobgoblins form tightly-knit clans together, bound by their shared talents. Those clans then merge to form tribes and societies. You choose to join a Martial Clan or an Arcana Clan.</p>
